        I'm a firm believer in the power of high fidelity prototypes as a means to deliver the best user outcomes. Being able to review the design and functionlity and conduct user testing the prototype evolves into what the website may look as a final product that meets expectations and requirments.

          <p>
            The iterative process of prototyping a design in collaboration with team members to find the solution that best benefits the user is at the heart of why I do what I do.

          <p>
            I create user friendly interfaces out of complex ideas that conform to current design methods, conventions and trends.

          <p>
            I use a static site generator to build and design high-fidelity functional prototypes using HTML/CSS/SASS and JavaScript.

          <h5 class="text-center">Quality Assurance</h5>
          <p>
            From the start of coding to post deployment I make sure the integrity and functionality of the design is maintained across multiple platforms and browsers.

    I believe in thoughtful design as a means to solve user problems. My expertise are in designing meaningful visual design through iterative process and prototyping. I enjoy working with teams of people to create and build web applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    At Dang & Blast, we concept, design and build digital products. We're firm believers in rapid prototyping, collaboration between disciplines, and thoughtful, creative solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love clean and modern web application design. I have strong attention to detail, work efficiently and have experience iterating over designs to ensure clients are 100% happy with the final product.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m a big-picture thinker with an eye for details. I love solving problems to improve people’s lives.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a designer because I want to actively pursue ways to reduce stress and improve people’s lives.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create straightforward and simple designs at all costs.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design things that are usable for the greatest number of people (accessibility). Do everything I can to support this within the boundaries of business needs.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solicit user feedback as often as possible. This truly is the gospel of informed design. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify and remove user frustration (see: “<a href="http://sensible.com/dmmt.html">Don’t Make Me Think</a>“). Every frustration is an injustice to the user. </span></li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain a laser focus; avoid distraction at all costs. This applies to both the product and the process.&nbsp;</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    My work focuses on building thoughtful, intuitive, and delightful interactions for the web, with a devotion to process, transparency, and sharing what I learn.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make it simple. The best solutions are easily understood and that’s the only way to scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    At its core design is about thoughtfully considering the right solutions to customer problems, and making good decisions to solve those problems
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I have proven ability distilling complex informational and functional design requirements into easy to use interfaces.</li>
    <li>I am committed to delivering the best-possible user experience that meets project requirements and deadlines.</li>
